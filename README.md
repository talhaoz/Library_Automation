# Library_Automation

Developed in Java to organize an existing automation and ensure that operations run properly. The program
can be authorized by two roles; admin and user. If you sign in as a user, you can borrow or return the book. If
you run the program as an admin, you can make the regulations about books and users. The system uses the
.csv files to keep the information during process.
